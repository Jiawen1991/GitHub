To install the connector extension 'duck' sample, execute the
following commands from the <installdir>/samples/connector
sub-directory:

% make
% cp libduck.so ../../connector/intel64/cpp

Note: GCC version 4.9.1 or later is needed.

Using an editor, add <entry>duck</entry> to the <clck-checks> block in
either your personal copy of clck.xml, or ../../etc/clck.xml to make
the change globally.
