    Intel(R) Trace Collector example - simple Jacobi iteration in Fortran

This code was adapted from the examples for "Using MPI" by William
Gropp, Ewing Lusk, and Anthony Skjellum, published by MIT Press (ISBN
0-262-57104-8). The original version (with the other examples from
this fine book) can be retrieved as
ftp://info.mcs.anl.gov/pub/mpi/using/examples.tar.

To instrument with ITC, the setup routine VTSETUP in VT.f was
added, in addition to calls to VTBEGIN() and VTEND() in each
subroutine/function. All the instrumentation code is enclosed in
#ifdef/#endif brackets; define the macro V_T to include
the instrumentation.

See also ../README.

Change the value of maxn in twod.F to adapt the gridsize (and thus the
computation/calculation ratio). Start the executable (vtjacobif or
vnjacobif) following the conventions of your system and MPI
implementation. vtjacobif accepts no command-line arguments.
