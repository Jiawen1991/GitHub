    Intel(R) Trace Collector example - simple Jacobi iteration in C

This code was adapted from the HTML MPI tutorial by William Gropp and
Ewing Lusk. The tutorial can be accessed as
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/Projects/mpi/index.html, and this example was
derived from the "Jacobi Iteration - Overlapping communication (sends
first)" exercise.

To instrument with ITC, the setup routine VT_setup in VT.c was
added, in addition to calls to VT_begin() and VT_end() in each
function. All the instrumentation code is enclosed in #ifdef/#endif
brackets; define the macro V_T to include the instrumentation.

See also ../README.

Start the executable (vtjacobic or vnjacobic) following the conventions of your system and MPI
implementation. It accepts the following command-line arguments:

  -print	switch on debugging output
  -maxit <iter>	set maximum iteration count to <iter>
  -n <rows>	set number of grid rows to <rows> (default 128)
  -m <cols>	set number of grid columns to <cols> (default 128)

The ratio of computation to calculation can be influenced by varying
<rows> and <cols>.
